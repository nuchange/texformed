###Reverse Innovation In Healthcare

Health Information Systems require standardized data entry forms (DEF) for a variety of applications such as patient data entry in electronic health records, computerized physician order entry (CPOE), and standardized order sets on paper. DEFs need to be customized according to the health condition, type of care offered and the specific requirements of the specialty.

Maintaining and updating the content of DEFs according to the latest evidence-based practice guidelines is a tough task. Rendering of DEFs on the computer screen or paper has an enormous impact on patient safety. Use of confusing abbreviations and inappropriate fonts may lead to events such as medication errors. 

DEFs can be shared across healthcare facilities and even across geographic borders. 
However, for open-source DEFs to be feasible, DEFs should be in a standard format. TeXForMed is an attempt to create such an open-source repository of DEFs using the ubiquitous LaTeX.

Using a LaTeX framework will facilitate the use of existing tools such as LaTeX editors. Rendering and formatting can be accurately reproduced on a computer screen and paper. Forms can be either rendered as HTML inside Health Information Systems or as PDF files for printing in resource deprived regions.
